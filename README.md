# BBC News Labs Bootstrap Theme

This is a BBC News Labs theme for Bootstrap, loosely based on the style of the beta version of the new BBC News responsive site.

e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014

This gives us a single theme to use across BBC News Labs experiments to quickly build prototypes with a unifed apperance, while being able to take advantage of the vast number of Bootstrap plugins and compatible extensions.

This theme was created with Themestrap, see themestrap-README.md for details.

# Demo

Example page for this theme:

## How to use it

To use this theme, just add this line to inside your <head> element:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://bootstrap.bbcnewslabs.co.uk/dist/css/bootstrap.css">
    

For JavaScript support - needed by some interactive elements - you will probably also want to include jQuery and the Bootstrap JavaScript (which requries jQuery).

You can find these hosted on the Google and Boostrap CDN's:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
